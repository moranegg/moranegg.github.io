        My name is Morane Ottilia Gruenpeter.

      <p class="contenu">After several years as a professional harp player, 
        I decided to change my career path and embark on a new journey 
        in software engineering and new technologies. 
        As an advocate for Open Science and Open Source Software, I'm committed
        to promote Research Software archival and curation.
        <br>

        My journey has been what the French call "atypique." 
        I came to France in 2011 to study music and later transitioned 
        to software engineering in Paris, marking a significant shift in my career. 
        In 2017, during my Master's degree, I began an internship at.

        with the

            Software Heritage
        </a></b> team to "build the semantic web of Free and Open Source 
        Software".

        <br>
        I remember how amazed I was by this idea to save source code and 
        preserve it and at the same time build a massive collection of 
        software with the full development history.

        Software Heritage is the universal source code archive, 
        here the word universal, 
        is important, because the archive is for everyone use. 
        It doesn't matter if you are a software engineer or 
        have a background in computer science.      
        <br>
        On a personal note, after growing up in Tel Aviv, 
        I now live in France with my partner and our two playful daughters, 
        continuously exploring new ways to appreciate life.
