      <p id="name" >
        My name is Morane Ottilia Gruenpeter.
      </p>

       <p class="contenu">As a lifelong optimist, I believe there is always hope -  
        even in the most uncertain situations. Change is inevitable, and we can 
        choose where we to focus our effort and energy.
        Curiosity without limits if a gift I choose to offer myself.
        Asking questions and challenging the status quo are essential parts of my journey.

      <p class="contenu">After several years as a professional harpist, 
        I made the bold decision to change career paths and embark on a new 
        journey in software engineering and emerging technologies. 
        Today, as a passionate advocate for Open Science and Open Source Software, 
        I’m committed to ensuring that software is recognized, preserved, 
        and valued as a key part of our collective knowledge—across research, 
        culture, and society. Whether through its archival, citation, 
        or integration into global infrastructures, I work to support software 
        as a durable and essential form of human expression and understanding.

        My path has taken unexpected turns, and even surprised me at times. 
        Growing up in Israel in a family that had to rebuild their lives from 
        profound loss taught me to appreciate the simplest things.

        <br>
        As an established musician in Israel and after the creation of the 
        IHS - Israeli Harpists Society, an association for harpists who wish to 
        open new harp classes in Israeli conservatories, I've decided that I
        need to broden my perspective and continue music studies in Paris,
        the capital of the harp.
        This is why I have moved to France in 2011, thinking it's temporary.
        <br> 
        Shortly after my arrival, a growing desire for adventure led me to 
        pursue a new direction. Exploration of different activities, brought
        me to discover software coding. I remember to this day, the feeling 
        I had while writing my first computer program in class - finding
        a solution to a problem through technology is an amazing feeling.
        <br>

        In 2017, during my Master's degree, I began an internship at.

        Software". This was big challenge to solve, and I've created this

            plan
        </a>. 
        
        <br>
        I remember how amazed I was by this idea to save source code and 
        preserve it and at the same time build a massive collection of 
        software with the full development history.

        Software Heritage is the universal archive of source code. 
        The word universal matters—it means the archive is for everyone. 
        Whether or not you’re a software engineer or have a 
        background in computer science, this resource is meant to 
        be open and accessible to all.    
        <br>
        I first encountered Open Science when joining the FORCE11 Software 
        Citation Implementation Working Group and the RDA Software Source Code 
        Interest Group. These communities introduced me to the importance of 
        transparency, reuse, and recognition in research—especially when it 
        comes to software, which has long been underrepresented and 
        underrecognized in academia. In that moment, I took on a personal 
        mission—well beyond the scope of my day-to-day work—to dedicate effort 
        and energy toward making a cultural change.
        <b>Making software a first class research output.</b>
        The journey is long, but seeing the evolution of this change is 
        extremely satisfying. It requires patience, hope, and a lot of 
        effort to sustain it and keep moving forward. Moreover, this 
        change is a community-driven change and requires collaboration 
        and connections.
        <br>
        On a personal note, I now live in France with my partner and our two playful daughters, 
        continuously exploring new ways to appreciate life.

        <br>
        This is my story- shaped by curiosity and a passion for making a difference.
