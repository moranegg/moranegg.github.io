            <h4>Letters to Daniel</h4>
            <p class="contenu">
                Ever since I can remember myself  I love cinema. Because of that,
                I went to “Thelma yellin” high-school of the arts, where I majored in Cinema. My final project was
                a documentary about the process of creating a film. I have chosen this project after my cousin
                <a href=”http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0344635/” tergat=”_blank”> Sacha Grunpeter </a>,
                who was a successful actor and screenwriter, died in a car accident. I admired him, he was a
                role model for me and I dreamed that when I’ll be older , I could share my projects with him and even create with  him. </p>

            <p class="contenu">
                On  the  morning of July 6th 2005 ,
                Los Angeles time , Sasha was on his way to shoot the last
                scene of <a href= "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443670/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1" target=”_blank”>“Tracing Cowboys”</a>
                .. that morning , on his way to the location, his car overturned , he didn't make it from this accident.
            </p>
            <p class="contenu">
                After that, I had to investigate the reasons why film-making was so important to me?
            </p>
            <p class="contenu">

                Making this film help me deal with the death of my role model and dream.
                This was the last film I have created,  I have dedicated it to Sacha.
