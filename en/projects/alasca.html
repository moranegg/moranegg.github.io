      Collaborative reinforcement learning (CRL) is a new approach in autonomic systems for self-
      management decision making. CRL allows to share effort between autonomic elements. We will show several
      CRL algorithms that insure global optimization while learning locally.
      Moreover, we will use a linguistic approach for learning communication and creating context in autonomic
      elements. A mapping of utility functions can be useful for reducing the state space of possible actions.
