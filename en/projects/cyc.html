		A computer program for a bicycle race that keeps track of the cyclists registration and
		performance .
		<br />
		The program that processes the data of a race must do the following actions:
		<ol>
			<li>Registration of competitors (Before)</li>

			<li>Withdrawals (Before and After)</li>

			<li>Disqualifications (After)</li>

			<li> Display the order of arrival (After)</li>
		</ol>

		Without a graphical user interface, just a static console program.
