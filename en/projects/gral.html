      Abstract. Immutable structures are naturally used in functional languages, each presenting a wide range of performances depending on the
  operation. For this paper we have chosen three data structures to study,
  compare and implement in C. AVL trees, RRB vectors and Finger trees
  all show three distinct, interesting approaches to immutable representa-
  tion of maps and vectors, each with a focus on different operations. In
  this paper, we will define each structure and the manner in which we
  implemented its operations. We will show the Finger trees are most ad-
  equate for discrete operations such as push and pop, while RRB vectors
  are best with bulk operation as split and merge.
  Keywords: immutable data structures, persistence, AVL, Relaxed-Radix-
  Balanced trees, Finger Trees [Jordi Bertran de Balanda, Morane Gruenpeter, Guillaume Hivert, Mourtala Issa Saidou
