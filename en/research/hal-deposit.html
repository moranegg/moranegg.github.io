			The collaboration between SWH, HAL-Inria, and the CSSD has resulted in,
			among others, two major impacts for researchers and the reproducibility
			of research and knowledge: it is now easy to provide a permanent home
			for the software that drives your work and it is possible to consistently
			cite and point to whole bodies of source code or specific lines within it.
			<br>
			<br>
			We look forward to seeing your deposits on SWH, and these new forms of
			software citation in your papers.
