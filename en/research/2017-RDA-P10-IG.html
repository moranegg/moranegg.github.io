					Software source code plays a critical role in all fields of modern
					research, where source code is written and developed to address a
					variety of needs, like cleaning, processing and visualising data.
					<br>
					<br>
					This interest group will provide a forum to discuss issues on management,
					sharing, discovery, archival and provenance of software source code.
					It will pay special attention to source code that generates research
					data and plays an important role in scientific publications.
