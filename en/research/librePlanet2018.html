  Abstract :

  Kat Thornton and Morane Gruenpeter

  Software dependencies. Software citation. Scientific reproducibility.
  Preservation of legacy software. These phrases bring to mind times
  we need to communicate about free software. From people who write
  software to people who organize and provide documentation of software,
  to end users searching for software, we all need to unambiguously refer
  to software in its complexity.

  We are representing two different initiatives actively building the
  semantic web of free software by sourcing software metadata, and creating
  mappings and links to software artifacts. Morane is the metadata lead for
  Software Heritage, an initiative striving to become the Library of
  Alexandria for software by collecting all publicly available software
  in source code form, together with its development history. Kat is
  metadata lead for Wikidata for Digital Preservation, a collaboration
  between the Wikidata community and the digital preservation community.
  Together, we are working to ensure that our approaches to solve the
  software metadata challenge are interoperable.
