      Abstract :
			<br>
			In the very broad scope addressed by digital preservation
			initiatives, a special place belongs to the scientific and technical
			artifacts that we need to properly archive to enable scientific
			reproducibility. For these artifacts we need identifiers that are not
			only unique and persistent, but also support integrity in an intrinsic
			way. They must provide strong guarantees that the object denoted by
			a given identifier will always be the same, without relying on third
			parties and external administrative processes. In this article, we report
			on our quest for this identifiers for digital objects (IDOs),
			whose properties are different from, and complementary to, those of the
			various digital identifiers of objects (DIOs) that are in widespread use
			today. We argue that both kinds of identifiers are needed and present
			the framework for intrinsic persistent identifiers that we have adopted
			in Software Heritage for preserving billions of software artifacts.
