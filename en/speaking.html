                I'm deeply passionate about changing the worldâ€”I believe transformative change happens through shared knowledge and engaging experiences. 
                I design my talks to be fun, memorable, and engaging, aiming to get the audience to have an active part, rather to being passivly listening. 
                I'm incredibly grateful to have traveled the world sharing my enthusiasm and insights about softwrae preservation, metadata, and open science
                with diverse and vibrant communities.
